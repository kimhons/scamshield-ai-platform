## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources**: The GitHub repository itself, including the source code, documentation, and configuration files.
- **Search strategies**: I will not need to use external search for this task, as the repository is the primary source of information.

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements**: The analysis will be based on the provided source code and documentation.
- **Cross-validation**: I will cross-reference information from different parts of the repository (e.g., README, source code, design documents) to ensure consistency and accuracy.

## Expected Deliverables
- A comprehensive repository review in a markdown file.
- The review will cover all the analysis requirements specified in the user's prompt.

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus**: Search-focused workflow to gather and analyze information from the repository.
- **Justification**: The task requires a deep dive into the provided repository to extract and synthesize information. A search-focused workflow is the most appropriate for this task.
